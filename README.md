# Discord-Bot-Web-Parser
<h2>The main idea for the bot</h2>
A program for personal use ordered by friends.
<br>
<br>1. The program must scan the web forum of the online game.
<br>2. The program should compare the input data from the site scan with previous data, if any.
<br>3. If there are new messages on the site and message text in special condition, it should be sent to the administrator or a specific user that there are new messages on the forum. (an example answer is attached below)
